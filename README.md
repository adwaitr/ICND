The project is based on the network design of a Company. It is crucial for a company to have a low-latency internal network connection for data transfer, electronic mail, attendance management, meeting scheduler etc. for the organization to function smoothly. Network design becomes a critical factor in assuring this. There are different departments within a company hence the distribution and configuration of network should be undertaken such that all departments can coordinate in a synchronized manner. A central management site that connects various such departments and processes queries in an environment that keep in question time and space complexity is required. Hence, we have designed an intra-company network design to suffice the required need.
